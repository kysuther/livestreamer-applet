##Cinnamon applet for the livestreamer cli program.   
__Install Instructions:__  
1.) Install livestreamer from your disto's repositories.  
2.) Copy the `livestreamer-applet@kysuther.com` folder into your "~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets" folder.  
3.) Add the applet to your panel through the applet manager in the settings application.  

__TODO:__  
1.) Retrieve quality options and allow the user to choose between them if they want.  
2.) Settings panel to set default quality and other settings (Current quality is set to 'best').
